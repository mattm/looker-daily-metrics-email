# Daily Metrics Email

See this post for background: [Building a Looker-Powered Daily Metrics Email Report
](https://mattmazur.com/2018/06/26/building-a-looker-powered-daily-metrics-email-report/).

## Installation

```
bundle install
```

## Sending the Email

First, configure the constants at the top of `run.rb`.

Then, set several environment variables (values you probably don't want to commit to your repo) before executing `run.rb`:

```
$ env LOOKER_CLIENT_ID="..." LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET="..." EMAIL_USER_NAME="..." EMAIL_PASSWORD="..." ruby run.rb
```

You'll want to customize the script according to your business's needs.
