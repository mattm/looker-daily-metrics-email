## Sending the Email

You'll need to provide several environment variables before executing `run.rb`:

```
$ env LOOKER_CLIENT_ID="..." LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET="..." LOOKER_API="https://example.looker.com:19999/api/3.0"  EMAIL_USER_NAME="..." EMAIL_PASSWORD="..." EMAIL_TO="..." EMAIL_FROM="..." EMAIL_SMTP="..." EMAIL_DOMAIN="..." ruby run.rb
